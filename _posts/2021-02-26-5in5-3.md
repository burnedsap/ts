## 5 in 5 â€“ 3

New ideals and paradigms of computing are exciting times to be in, and there's no better way to indulge than to think of the radical ways in which computing and machine intelligence can be re-designed. The first prototypes of the CCC (Closed Cycle Computing) standard are an exciting breed of machines which promise (finally) a sustainable way to compute.



#### ClickerTrainer

The ClickerTrainer is an analogue take on training intelligences. The handheld device contains no batteries, and solely uses a clicker to momentarily power a capacitor. The capacitor provides a burst of energy which is used to power the computer and register data. The dial on the device adjusts the moment of power generated by the button using pre-set tensioners. It is also used to input different values for the training.

#### Hand Cranked PlantPC

This hand cranked beauty is the computing centerpiece of your home. With a houseplant providing the natural intelligence and training data, all it takes to power it is a few turns of the crank to keep the process of osmosis and photosynthesis going for a while. The modular design allows for the addition of compute models and plants to build your collection.

#### PSoup Plank

Designed for hobbyists, this module solely uses natural intelligence as it's compute element. The closed loop cycle is enclosed in a crystal with 3 input/output channels to interact with it. Analogue dials provide easy to access to the controls in a server stack setup. Multiply the compute power with multiple planks connected via a sterilised plumbing system.
