August 2013 Pages 171–172 | Social and professional topics, Computing education, Computing educational programs, | This paper looks at how Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) can be used "as an educational platform to engage students in a collaborative exploration of the field of computing as a means to increase interest in computing". This is an interesting approach toward education as it explores new mediums and types of content delivery. | A look at new approaches toward education on computers using computers |

This "relies on software defined radios and open-source solutions to provide free local and cheap long-distance communication for remote regions". | The focus on using existing tech stacks is of particular interest to me. The implementation of this does raise some questions which I'd like to keep in mind. |

It "operates using satellite terminals (for connection to the Internet) and a wireless local area network." Especially with regard to the potential use cases of this application. | Great use of older tech, especially with the uses cases mentioned of helping communities |

The key here is to look at a planet-centered approach toward design. |

However, so-called TinyML presents severe technical challenges, as deep neural network inference demands a large compute and memory budget. To address this challenge, neural architecture search (NAS) promises to help design accurate ML models that meet the tight MCU memory, latency and energy constraints. |                                                              |
