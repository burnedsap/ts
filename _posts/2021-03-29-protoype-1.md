## Prototype 1

After the mid-term presentations and reviewing the feedback I received, I found myself cornered by my own work. I enjoyed the journey so far, as outlined in the mid-term presentation, but I find myself feeling quite lost now. The question I highlighted at the end of my presentation: "What does a planet-centered machine intelligence look like?" now seems insurmountable. From the feedback I received, the one that stood out to me the most was, "Instigate questions". I started on this journey asking myself questions, and the way forward was perhaps in the same direction. 



A medium that I find particularly interesting is that of patent applications. They're often used as pointers to get an understanding of new technologies under development, and elicit strong responses if they're noteworthy. Exactly what I'd like to create. Hence, I set about creating a patent application which paints a vision of an alternate world where planet-centered machine intelligence exists.



View the patent application [here](https://burnedsap.github.io/ms2/media/WWFNIS%20Draft%20Patent%20Application.pdf). Feedback of any sort is welcome!
