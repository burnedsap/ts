## Prototype 2

Inspired by the zine Computer Lib/Dream Machines created by Ted Nelson, I've created a [zine of my own](https://burnedsap.github.io/ms2/media/Alternate%20Visions%20of%20Machines%20and%20Machine%20Intelligence.pdf), with seeds of ideas sketching out different possibilities in which a future with alternative visions of machine intelligence could look like. 



Feedback welcome as always!
