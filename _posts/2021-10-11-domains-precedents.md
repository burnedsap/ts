I’m not entirely sure of the domain I’m working within, or intent to work within. There are multiple domains I’m covering, some intentionally, others less so.

<u>Speculative Design</u>\
This is a domain I am not interested in, but would like my project to fall under. Speculative design is the creation of alternate realities or worlds, which allow us to reflect on our current reality. Speculative design allows me the freedom to work within a space not bound by the restrictions of our reality. There are however, multiple flavours, or kinds of speculative design practice. The ones practiced by folks like Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby or the realities painted by video games such as Antariksha Sanchar are the ones I’m keen on. I would like to create objects which hint at alternate realities, but give the viewer the freedom to fill in the blanks and extrapolate from the hints presented to them.

<u>Human Computer Interface</u>\
The field of Human Computer Interface (HCI) is a fascinating one. The name itself acknowledges the difference between humans and the machines we build, primarily for our use. The field is constantly changing and evolving as we discover new affordances of our machines. There is a heavy bias, or focus on the interactions being as simple or as efficient as possible. The workings of the machines are often hidden away and we are not made aware of their inner workings. I’d like to work within this domain, and focus more on the emotional relationships we share with the machines. Machines have grown to become more than just objects, and have become akin to companions or persons. What does that mean for our relationships with them?

<u>Interface Architecture</u>\
The architecture of interfaces affect how we interact with our machines. Certain interface architectures create and reinforce power relations, whereas others encourage participants to bring about change. The gradual disappearance of hierarchical file systems from computers might be convenient for some, but it also hides the workings of where data is stored and in which format. What sort of interfaces would we want to build for ourselves?
