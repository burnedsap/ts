## 5 in 5 â€“ 1

To get a better understand of what the future with local machine learning devices will look like, I created a timeline visualising the future. Although purely speculative, the intent is to explore both positive and negative events for a balanced view of the future. The timeline uses time along the x-axis, and degree of preferability along the y-axis. Preferability is quite subjective, and so this is a vision of the future tinted with my thoughts and opinions.

The yellow marked post-its are the ones I feel are interesting, and do see how the events play out through the timeline!
