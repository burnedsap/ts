### Mind Maps
Making mind maps is difficult when it is not yet known what I’m working on, but it’s also a critical step of figuring out what to work on. I created a few mind maps to help me figure out what I’m working on. The first one is an unstructured attempt, with lots of ideas and thoughts floating around in the textual ether.

To help visualise the future, Nishra and I worked on a Futures Cone. The resulting map in itself isn't as interesting as the conversations we had during the making of it. These discussions were immensely helpful in helping me understand what I want to work on.

The second attempt at a mindmap was far more structured, building off from the futures cone and the unstructured map

### Annotated Bibliography

Solarpunk literature imagines new futures in the shadow of and in opposition to environmental change and collapse, then works to create those futures. A solarpunk doesn’t just have ideas and beliefs; a solarpunk enacts. On paper, being a solarpunk might sound like being a Marxist, a municipalist, or another ideology entirely. Yet, a different kind of necessity turns solarpunk thought into action. Mainly extinction. In other words, solarpunk literature is not just about solar.                                                             | Solarpunk envisions a possible utopian future: the opposite of cyberpunk    |

Despite its simplicity, the concept of habituation seems to have always stirred great debate. For example, the earliest descriptions of what we would now call habituation came from studies conducted by Pfeffer using the sensitive plant Mimosa pudica in 1873 and the Peckhams using spiders in 1887; remarkably, no real agreement on the use of the word ‘habituation’ was to be found until (almost) a whole century later (see review by Christoffersen 1997). | alternate intelligences and models of intelligence                          |

Their close relationship with the field of computer wearables gives us many diverging research directions and possible definitions. On one end of the spectrum, there are pragmatic applications such as military research into interactive camouflage or textiles that can heal wounded soldiers. On the other end of the spectrum, work is being done by artists and designers in the area of reactive clothes: "second skins" that can adapt to the environment and to the individual.                                                | materiality and computing, organic form of machine and machine intelligence |
