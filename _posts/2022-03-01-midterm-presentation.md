### Self Assessment

The midterm presentation was useful, not only for getting useful feedback from critics, but also in helping me take stock and assess my own progress. The process of making a presentation is a great way to reflect on the project and spot areas to work on. I realised that I have made progress since the start of the semester, which is always encouraging. The narrative of the project is starting to come together as well.

_2/4_
This didn't go as well as I'd hoped. The presentation slides weren't bad, and the timing was okay. I usually end on 7 minutes but I was tripping over some words and getting a bit lost in the narrative. It could definitely be cleaner. The idea was conveyed successfully, to a point where the critics identified better ways to describe it. 

4 Critical Thinking and Reflective Judgment

3 Design Process

3 Contextualization, Conclusion and Evaluation
