As the semester draws to a close, I can finally present a final form of my efforts from across the thesis semesters: [The Planetary Bureau](https://theplanetarybureau.com). All the work from the semester, barring a few explorations can be found on this website. The Planetary Bureau is the result of many mistakes, some surprises, and a lot of thinking. The failures and mistakes are the defining features of the project, and those have been the greatest learnings, even if the final result isn't up to my expectations.

What started out in 2021 as an exploration of what machines meant to me, and the emotional relationship I have with certain machines turned into a 9-month exercise of trying to escape the human, and the human gaze of the world around me. The underlying intent of thesis was to work on something which would push the viewer to live a more sustainable life. The first approach was to increase the life of machines we use by building an emotional and meaningful relationship with them. My inability to properly flesh this out led me to a dead-end on this approach.
