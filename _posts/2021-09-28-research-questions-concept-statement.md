### Concept Statement
I am researching **Human Machine Relations**  
in the domain of **HCI**  
so that I can find out **better ways of interacting with our machines**.  
My goal is to propose a solution to this problem in the form of **multiple prototypes**  
with affordances, including **new kinds of machine intelligence, multi-species communication, and creating emotional relationships with machines**  
so that people may **build new kinds of sustainable, diverse, and emotional machines**.  
  

### Research Questions
My concept statement is fairly broad, and encompasses within it an ever expanding scope of research. I've framed my concept statement in a vague manner, as I'd like to expand my scope of research before narrowing it down to a few topics. Some of the key questions for my project are:  
<br>
- New models of computing
    - Emotional connections with machines
    - metrics of success (carbon footprint, repairability, lifespan, etc.)
    - What could healthier interactions look like?
    - Rethinking data structures
    - Subvert web 3.0
    - 'healthy' behaviours with digital technology?
    - how do different interfaces/mental models affect our use of technology?

<br>

- New kinds of machine intelligences
    - Planet centered machine intelligence
    - Multi-species communication and intelligence networks
    - closed loop machine learning practices (Data, energy, ownership, etc.)
    - Tapping into non-human intelligences  

The intent is to create a few small prototypes, each of which will explore a certain topic or idea. The next step after this will be to frame a list of questions, and then go about answering them with research and eventually a prototype. Small, interactive prototypes which focus on the user experience and frameworks are preferable as they can be used to further ask more questions and provoke conversations.
