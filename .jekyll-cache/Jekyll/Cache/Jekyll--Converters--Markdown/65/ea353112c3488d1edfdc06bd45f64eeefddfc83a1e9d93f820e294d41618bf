<p>After the mid-term presentations and reviewing the feedback I received, I found myself cornered by my own work. I enjoyed the journey so far, as outlined in the mid-term presentation, but I find myself feeling quite lost now. The question I highlighted at the end of my presentation: â€œWhat does a planet-centered machine intelligence look like?â€ now seems insurmountable. From the feedback I received, the one that stood out to me the most was, â€œInstigate questionsâ€. I started on this journey asking myself questions, and the way forward was perhaps in the same direction.</p>

<p>A medium that I find particularly interesting is that of patent applications. Theyâ€™re often used as pointers to get an understanding of new technologies under development, and elicit strong responses if theyâ€™re noteworthy. Exactly what Iâ€™d like to create. Hence, I set about creating a patent application which paints a vision of an alternate world where planet-centered machine intelligence exists.</p>

<p>View the patent application <a href="https://burnedsap.github.io/ms2/media/WWFNIS%20Draft%20Patent%20Application.pdf">here</a>. Feedback of any sort is welcome!</p>
