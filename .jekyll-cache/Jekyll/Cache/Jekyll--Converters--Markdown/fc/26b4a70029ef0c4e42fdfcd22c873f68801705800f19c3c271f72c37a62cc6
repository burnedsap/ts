  <p>The TinyML paradigm proposes to integrate Machine Learning (ML)-based mechanisms within small objects powered by Microcontroller Units (MCUs). This paves the way for the development of novel applications and services that do not need the omnipresent processing support from the cloud, which is power consuming and involves data security and privacy risks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Executing machine learning workloads locally on resource constrained microcontrollers (MCUs) promises to drastically expand the application space of IoT. However, so-called TinyML presents severe technical challenges, as deep neural network inference demands a large compute and memory budget. To address this challenge, neural architecture search (NAS) promises to help design accurate ML models that meet the tight MCU memory, latency and energy constraints.</p>
