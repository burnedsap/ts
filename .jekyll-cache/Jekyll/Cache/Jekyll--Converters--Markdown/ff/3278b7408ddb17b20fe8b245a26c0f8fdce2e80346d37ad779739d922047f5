<p>Enough talk, time to get started on actually making an intelligence. Itâ€™s genuinely mind-blowing to read about other kinds of intelligences, and a talk at the World Science Festival took it a step further. I sincerely urge you to listen to this panel speak. In the midst of some heavy science flavoured flirting, youâ€™ll realise how weâ€™re living in the midst of some truly alien creatures right here on our very own planet.</p>

<p>After all this listening, I simply had to take a crack at trying to create my own intelligent being. I started coding using p5js and after some thinking, I decided to take an interative approach at creating this intelligence. First, I created the Being. A simple white square on the screen. Itâ€™s very existence on the screen hinted at intelligence. I couldâ€™ve simply left it at this stage, content with the intelligence it had.</p>

<p>But I decided to press on further. Eager to give it some capabilities, I blessed it with the ability to move. It would hobble about at random, with no intent or direction. It now existed and could move around.</p>

<p>I then gave it a sense, the sense to feel when another presence is close to it. In this case, it can sense the cursor close itâ€™s physical being.</p>

<p>To give it a sense of purpose and a way to sustain itself, I then gave it the ability to eat, and additionally the ability to sense food.</p>

<p>Interact with the intelligent Being here:</p>

<p>Although it was challenging coding these rules in, the process of doing so did get me thinking about intelligence, and the purpose of my creation. Staring at a blank screen, I couldnâ€™t think of anything radical, and so I give it an intelligence I was familiar with-locomotion, eating, and sensing. My context heavily influenced the decisions I made. Given enough time and space, perhaps I might be able to break out of this context bubble and think of different kinds of intelligences.</p>

<p>The value of the intelligence is heavily dependent within the context within which it exists. An antâ€™s intelligence may not be very useful as a single entity as compared to a nest of ants. Human intelligence may be very well suited for Earth, but could be completely useless on Venus, or on a different plane of existence.</p>

<p>Could there be other kinds of intelligences which machine intelligences could adopt? Perhaps intelligences that arenâ€™t purely functional, but serve to add other kinds of value? What would a non-human centered machine intelligence look like? Or a planet-centered one? Time to join the Machinists.</p>
