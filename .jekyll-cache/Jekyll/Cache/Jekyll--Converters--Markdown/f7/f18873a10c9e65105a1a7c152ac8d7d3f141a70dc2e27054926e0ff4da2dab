<p>Inspired by the zine Computer Lib/Dream Machines created by Ted Nelson, Iâ€™ve created a <a href="https://burnedsap.github.io/ms2/media/Alternate%20Visions%20of%20Machines%20and%20Machine%20Intelligence.pdf">zine of my own</a>, with seeds of ideas sketching out different possibilities in which a future with alternative visions of machine intelligence could look like.</p>

<p>Feedback welcome as always!</p>
