<p>New ideals and paradigms of computing are exciting times to be in, and thereâ€™s no better way to indulge than to think of the radical ways in which computing and machine intelligence can be re-designed. The first prototypes of the CCC (Closed Cycle Computing) standard are an exciting breed of machines which promise (finally) a sustainable way to compute.</p>

<h4 id="clickertrainer">ClickerTrainer</h4>

<p>The ClickerTrainer is an analogue take on training intelligences. The handheld device contains no batteries, and solely uses a clicker to momentarily power a capacitor. The capacitor provides a burst of energy which is used to power the computer and register data. The dial on the device adjusts the moment of power generated by the button using pre-set tensioners. It is also used to input different values for the training.</p>

<h4 id="hand-cranked-plantpc">Hand Cranked PlantPC</h4>

<p>This hand cranked beauty is the computing centerpiece of your home. With a houseplant providing the natural intelligence and training data, all it takes to power it is a few turns of the crank to keep the process of osmosis and photosynthesis going for a while. The modular design allows for the addition of compute models and plants to build your collection.</p>

<h4 id="psoup-plank">PSoup Plank</h4>

<p>Designed for hobbyists, this module solely uses natural intelligence as itâ€™s compute element. The closed loop cycle is enclosed in a crystal with 3 input/output channels to interact with it. Analogue dials provide easy to access to the controls in a server stack setup. Multiply the compute power with multiple planks connected via a sterilised plumbing system.</p>
